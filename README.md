# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

# Overview
This analysis is based on data from multiple urban, suburban and rural cities where the ride-sharing app is used. This data includes average fare, driver and ride count and dates. The analysis was performed to provide helpful insight to perhaps modify different aspects of the company to improve user-experience.   

# Results
It's evident that there is a corelation in between population and the average fare. In rural cities, the average fare is higher than in sururban or urban citis. This is posibly do to scarcity of drivers which allows the existing drivers to determine the fare without needing to compete for their service as there is little demand.

# Summary
Another observation we are able to extract from the data is drivers in suburban areas seem to have made more profict during the end of February while their rural counterparts reached their peaks at the beginning of April.
